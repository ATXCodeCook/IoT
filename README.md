This program will prompt the user for intergers and add them to an array
(stack). The stack will hold up to 10 values. When the user inputs 'add'
the top two values of the stack will be popped and added. Then, the result
will be pushed back onto the stack. The program does validation for
positive integers, 'add' and 'quit'.
